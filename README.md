# Formula Calculator

## Overview

The Formula Calculator is a React-based web application designed to evaluate mathematical formulas dynamically. Users can input numerical values for variables and select or enter formulas to calculate results based on specific algebraic expansions.

## Features

- **Dynamic Input Handling:** Input values for variables \(a\), \(b\), and optionally \(c\), and enter formulas using these variables.
- **Formula Expansion:** Automatically expands specific formulas like \((a + b)^2\), \((a - b)^2\), \((a + b + c)^2\), and \((a - b - c)^2\) into their expanded forms.
- **Interactive Formula Selection:** Click on predefined formulas to auto-populate the formula input field.
- **Error Handling:** Provides feedback for incomplete fields, invalid inputs, and formula syntax issues.
- **Result Display:** Shows the computed result or any errors encountered during calculation.
